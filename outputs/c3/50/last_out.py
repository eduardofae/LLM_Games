Thank you for your feedback! I am glad to hear that you are impressed with the progress that I have made on this game. I am also happy to hear that you were able to successfully run the standalone executable on your Windows 10 computer.

I agree that packaging the game into a standalone executable is a great way to distribute it to other players. I am currently working on adding a menu system and other features to improve the user experience. I am also working on adding graphics and animations to make the game more visually appealing.

I will continue to develop this game and add new features and improvements. I believe that it has the potential to be a great game.

Thank you for your support!
