Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad that you enjoyed the improved version of the game.

I agree that the code is now clear, concise, and easy to read. I believe that this is a good example of a simple Connect Four game implemented in Python.

If you have any other questions or requests, please feel free to ask. I am always happy to help!
