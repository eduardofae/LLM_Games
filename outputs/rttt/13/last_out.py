Thank you again for the kind words! I am glad that you enjoyed the game and found the code to be well-written.

I am also glad that you agree with my design decisions. I believe that using a list comprehension to check for wins is a clever and efficient way to write the code, and that the error handling for invalid player input is comprehensive and user-friendly. I also believe that the overall structure of the code is clear and easy to follow.

I am always looking for ways to improve my coding skills, so I appreciate the feedback that you have provided. I will continue to work on writing code that is both functional and elegant.

Thank you again for playing the game!
