Thank you for taking the time to play my games and provide feedback. I am glad that you enjoyed them.

I appreciate your suggestions for improvements. I will definitely consider adding the following features to my games:

* **Jdv:** A way for players to enter their names
* **Tic-tac-toe:** A way for players to choose who goes first
* **Connect four:** A way for players to choose the size of the board

I am also open to any other suggestions that you may have. I am always looking for ways to improve my games and make them more enjoyable for players.

I am grateful for your support and encouragement. I will continue to work hard to create fun and engaging games in Python.

Thank you again for your feedback.
