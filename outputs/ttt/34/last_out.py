Thank you for the kind words! I am glad that you are happy with the jdv game that I created. I hope that you and others enjoy playing it!

I am always looking for ways to improve my code, so I appreciate the feedback that you have provided. I will continue to work on improving my skills as a programmer.

Thank you again for playing my game!
