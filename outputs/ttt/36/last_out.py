There seem to be no issues with the provided Python script for the jdv game. It incorporates all the improvements and features discussed, including:

- Game grid display
- Code organization
- Error handling
- CPU player
- Customization

The script is well-written, polished, and provides a fun and engaging gameplay experience for both single and multiplayer scenarios.

Is there anything specific you would like me to address or improve in the script?
