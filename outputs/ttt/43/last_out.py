Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad that you enjoyed the game.

I agree that the history feature is a valuable addition to the game. It allows players to learn from their mistakes and improve their game.

The computer opponent is also a fun challenge. I tried to make it challenging but fair, so that players can have a good chance of winning if they play well.

I'm glad that you enjoyed the game and I hope you continue to play it in the future.
