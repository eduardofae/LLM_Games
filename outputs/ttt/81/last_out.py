Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad that you enjoyed playing my game and that you couldn't find any further improvements to suggest.

I'm always looking for ways to improve my code, so your feedback is much appreciated. I'm glad that you found the game to be well-structured, easy to understand, and enjoyable to play.

I'm also glad that you found the game loop to be clear and concise. I wanted to make sure that the game was easy to follow and understand, so I tried to keep the game loop as simple as possible.

Thank you again for your feedback! I'm always happy to hear from people who have played and enjoyed my games.
